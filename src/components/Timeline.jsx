        i think it has to do with aku mau jabarin semua that has been going since our first day up till now... but hey, i'll do it anyways trying to summarize everything. here we gooo,
        I still remember the very first time i laid my eyes on you, you were so pretty that day 'no this is not bulshit' i'm being fr. the first time i saw you i was like, this girl got
        a nice smile, and she's smart too, kind also... and then it was around the 8th of august if i remember correctly, was the first time i saw you
        without your hijab and i'm flabbergasted LIKE YOU ARE SO PRETTY I LOVE YOUR HAIR... fast forwad when the first time you chatted me i was like... IS THIS FOR REAL? and yeah it is, 
        then soon we were together. i still remember our 'my' awkwardness when we took pics hehe... i'm so sorry... still is kinda awkward to this day. we went through so much since our
        first year of being togehter, and yet we still stay despite everything. then LDR came... it was tough too... but we still manage despite of it all, even when it seems impossible. 
        We have so many fights during our highschool years yet we still stay, we still being strong for eachother believing that everything will end the way we wanted to. And now...
        we've been together for 8 years, and through all that, it wasn't an easy one up until this point banyak banget breaking point kita... so much things that i'm not even proud of doing
        and almost everything is my fault and i'm sorry for that... i always thank you everyday that you still want to try for us. try to get that ending we're chasing. thank you for giving
        me a chance, thank you for believing me, i wont let you down. i'm sorry for my past behaviour. i'll be better for us sayang. i'll take us to the ending we want. I love you.
